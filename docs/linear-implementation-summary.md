# Linear Integration Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Goal Achieved

Successfully implemented the `list_linear_issues` MCP tool as the first Linear integration feature according to the PRD requirements.

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### Core Implementation

- `app/[transport]/lib/linear/types.ts` - TypeScript types and interfaces for Linear API
- `app/[transport]/lib/linear/client.ts` - Linear GraphQL API client
- `app/[transport]/lib/linear/utils.ts` - Utility functions for formatting and display
- `app/[transport]/route.ts` - Updated with Linear tool integration

### Dependencies Added

- `graphql` - GraphQL support
- `graphql-request` - GraphQL client library

### Documentation & Testing

- `docs/linear-integration.md` - User documentation and usage examples
- `scripts/test-linear-client.mjs` - Test script for Linear API client
- `package.json` - Added test script command

## 🔧 Features Implemented

### `list_linear_issues` Tool

**Complete implementation** with all requested filtering options:

- ✅ **Assignee filtering** - By user ID or email
- ✅ **Status filtering** - By issue state/status name
- ✅ **Priority filtering** - By priority level (0-4)
- ✅ **Labels filtering** - By array of label names
- ✅ **Team filtering** - By team ID or key
- ✅ **Project filtering** - By project ID
- ✅ **Pagination** - Cursor-based with limit control
- ✅ **Error handling** - Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Additional Features

- ✅ **Current user detection** - Automatically detect current user
- ✅ **Team listing** - Helper method to get available teams
- ✅ **Smart filtering** - Auto-detect email vs ID for assignee
- ✅ **Formatted output** - Clean, readable issue summaries
- ✅ **Pagination support** - Handle large result sets

## 🎛️ Usage Examples

```bash
# Test the integration
export LINEAR_API_KEY="your-api-key"
pnpm test:linear

# In Cursor with MCP
"Show me my Linear issues"
"Show me Linear issues that are In Progress"
"Show me urgent Linear issues for the ENG team"
"Show me Linear issues with labels bug and frontend"
```

## 📊 Response Format

Each issue includes:

- Issue identifier (e.g., ENG-123)
- Title and description
- Status and priority
- Assignee information
- Team and project details
- Labels and estimates
- Dates and Linear URL

## 🔒 Security & Configuration

- Environment variable for API key (`LINEAR_API_KEY`)
- Proper error handling for missing credentials
- Rate limiting awareness
- Secure GraphQL client configuration
- Direct API key authentication (Linear doesn't use Bearer prefix)

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test coverage:

- API key validation
- Authentication verification
- GraphQL query execution
- Data transformation
- Output formatting
- Error scenarios

## 🚀 Next Steps (Future Phases)

Ready for Phase 2 implementation:

1. `get_linear_issue` - Get detailed issue information
2. `create_linear_issue_from_text` - Create issues from selected text
3. `update_linear_issue` - Update existing issues
4. Advanced filtering and search
5. Workflow automation features

## 📋 PRD Compliance

✅ **All MVP requirements met:**

- Query issues by assignee (default: current user)
- Filter by status, priority, labels, team, project
- Show issue ID, title, status, priority, assignee
- Support pagination for large result sets
- Proper parameter validation and error handling

The implementation is production-ready and follows the established MCP patterns in the codebase.
